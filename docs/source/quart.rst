Quart
=====

.. versionadded:: 3.2

Overview
--------

The Quart module provides routines for automatically
analyzing DICOM images of the Quart DVT phantom typically used with the Halcyon linac system.
It can load a folder or zip file of images, correcting for
translational and rotational offsets.

.. versionadded:: 3.2

.. warning::

    These algorithms have only a limited amount of testing data and results should be scrutinized.
    Further, the algorithm is more likely to change in the future when a more robust test suite is built up.

Typical Use
-----------

The Quart phantom analysis follows a similar pattern of load/analyze/output as the rest of the library.
Unlike the CatPhan analysis, customization is not a goal, as the phantoms and analyses
are much more well-defined. I.e. there's less of a use case for custom phantoms in this
scenario.

To use the Quart analysis, import the class:

.. code-block:: python

    from pylinac import QuartDVT
    from pylinac.quart import QuartDVT  # equivalent import

And then load, analyze, and view the results:

* **Load images** -- Loading can be done with a directory or zip file:

  .. code-block:: python

    quart_folder = r"C:/CT/Quart/Sept 2021"
    quart = QuartDVT(quart_folder)


  or load from zip:

  .. code-block:: python

    quart_folder = (
        r"C:/CT/Quart/Sept 2021.zip"  # this contains all the DICOM files of the scan
    )
    quart = QuartDVT.from_zip(quart_folder)

* **Analyze** -- Analyze the dataset:

  .. code-block:: python

    quart.analyze()

* **View the results** -- Reviewing the results can be done in text or dict format
  as well as images:

  .. code-block:: python

    # print text to the console
    print(quart.results())
    # view analyzed image summary
    quart.plot_analyzed_image()
    # view images independently
    quart.plot_images()
    # save the images
    quart.save_images()
    # finally, save a PDF
    quart.publish_pdf("myquart.pdf")

Hypersight
----------

.. versionadded:: 3.17

The Hypersight variant of the Quart phantom includes a water ROI in the HU module.
The Quart analysis automatically detects whether the water vial is present and filled,
and reports the additional ROI analysis results for the water bubble.

.. warning::

    .. versionchanged:: 3.37

    In earlier versions, the Hypersight variant had its own class.
    Starting with v3.37, there is now a unified Quart Phantom class
    that automatically detects the water vial. This class is now deprecated but remains in the
    event the automatic water vial detection of the ``QuartDVT`` class is incorrect.
    It will be removed in a future release.

Advanced Use
------------

Adjusting ROI locations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To adjust ROI locations, see the sister section for CT analysis: :ref:`adjusting-roi-locations`.

Using ``results_data``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the Quart module in your own scripts? While the analysis results can be printed out,
if you intend on using them elsewhere (e.g. in an API), they can be accessed the easiest by using the :meth:`~pylinac.quart.QuartDVT.results_data` method
which returns a :class:`~pylinac.quart.QuartDVTResult` instance.

Continuing from above:

.. code-block:: python

    data = quart.results_data()
    data.hu_module.roi_radius_mm
    # and more

    # return as a dict
    data_dict = quart.results_data(as_dict=True)
    data_dict["hu_module"]["roi_radius_mm"]
    ...

Analysis Parameters
-------------------

.. tab-set::
   :sync-group: usage

   .. tab-item:: pylinac
      :sync: pylinac

      See :meth:`pylinac.quart.QuartDVT.analyze` for details.

   .. tab-item:: RadMachine
      :sync: radmachine

      * **HU Tolerance**: The tolerance in HU for the phantom materials.
      * **Scaling tolerance**: The tolerance in mm for the scaling of the phantom.
      * **Slice thickness tolerance**: The tolerance in mm for the slice thickness.
      * **CNR Ratio**: The required minimum ratio for the contrast-to-noise to be considered passing.
      * **X adjustment**: A fine-tuning adjustment to the detected x-coordinate of the phantom center. This will move the
        detected phantom position by this amount in the x-direction in mm. Positive values move the phantom to the right.
      * **Y adjustment**: A fine-tuning adjustment to the detected y-coordinate of the phantom center. This will move the
        detected phantom position by this amount in the y-direction in mm. Positive values move the phantom down.
      * **Angle adjustment**: A fine-tuning adjustment to the detected angle of the phantom. This will rotate the phantom by this amount in degrees.
        Positive values rotate the phantom clockwise.
      * **ROI size factor**: A fine-tuning adjustment to the ROI sizes of the phantom. This will scale the ROIs by this amount.
        Positive values increase the ROI sizes. In contrast to the scaling adjustment, this
        adjustment effectively makes the ROIs bigger or smaller, but does not adjust their position.
      * **Scaling factor**: A fine-tuning adjustment to the detected magnification of the phantom. This will zoom the ROIs and phantom outline (if applicable) by this amount.
        In contrast to the roi size adjustment, the scaling adjustment effectively moves the phantom and ROIs
        closer or further from the phantom center. I.e. this zooms the outline and ROI positions, but not ROI size.
      * **Origin slice**: The slice number that corresponds to the HU linearity slice.
        This is a fallback mechanism in case the automatic detection fails.

Algorithm
---------

The Quart algorithm is nearly the same as the :ref:`CBCT Algorithm <cbct-algorithm>`. The
image loading and localization use the same type of logic.

.. _quart-high-res:

High-Resolution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For high-resolution resolvability, the Quart manual does describe an equation for calculating
the MTF using the line-spread function (LSF) of the phantom edge. For simplicity,
we use the Varian Halcyon IPA document, which outlines a similar logic
with specific measurements of the -700 -> -200 HU distance using a vertical
and horizontal profile.

Within pylinac, to reduce the number of input parameters and also match commissioning
values, these are the values used. The result is the distance in mm from
these two HU values.

.. note::

  The images in pylinac are "grounded", meaning -1000 -> 0. So the actual algorithm
  search values are +300 HU (-700 + 1000) and +800 HU (-200 + 1000).


CNR/SNR
^^^^^^^

While normally the :ref:`contrast <contrast>` algorithm is chosen by the user,
for the Quart phantom it is hardcoded based on the equations in the manual.
Specifically, contrast to noise is defined as:

.. math:: \frac{|Polystyrene - Acrylic|}{Acrylic}

where the values are the median pixel value of the given ROI. Poly
was given as a possible recommendations in the Quart user manual.
Acrylic is the base material of the phantom, i.e. background.

.. note:: The numerator is an absolute value.

The signal to noise is defined as:

.. math:: \frac{Polystyrene + 1000}{\sigma_{Polystyrene}}

where :math:`\sigma` is the standard deviation of the Polystyrene ROI pixel values.
The poly ROI was chosen by us to match the selection for the CNR equation.
