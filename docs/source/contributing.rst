Contributing
============

There are several ways you can contribute to the pylinac project no matter your skill level. Read on for more info.

.. note::

    This page is meant for people who are not developers. If you are a developer who wants to contribute
    or extend your own pylinac fork, please read the :ref:`developer-guide` instead.

Submitting bugs
---------------

The easiest way to contribute is to report bugs. Submit bugs via a Github issue `here <https://github.com/jrkerns/pylinac/issues>`__.

Submitting files
----------------

Another easy way to improve pylinac is to submit QA files for the testing repository. Files are treated anonymously and are
added to the test suite so that the package will become more robust. You can submit files `here <https://forms.gle/sfrDXL3XhHsyiKeJ7>`__.

Suggesting ideas
----------------

Ideas are always welcome (though they might not get implemented). You can submit new ideas `here <https://github.com/jrkerns/pylinac/issues>`_.
